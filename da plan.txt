- game mode:
    - 1v1
    - lobby
    - probably needs start and end loop and conditions to know when to start/stop the game
- fine tuned gunplay
- fine tuned movement:
    - air movement too "erratic"
    - needs deacceleration and slower acceleration on the ground (maybe more friction?)
    - slipping on slopes
- multiplayer
- implement secret room 

- pickups
    - health kit
    - ammo
- different game modes for the future:
    - king of the hill mode
    - deathmatch mode
    - 1v1 arena mode like in counter strike community servers

done:
- make a simple greybox stage in blender
    - start with 20x20 grid of squares and pull them up, add ramps and bridges and other elements for more dynamic gameplay
- make another greybox stage in blender to practice switching between stages
